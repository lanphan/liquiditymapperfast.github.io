/**
 * Slicers: an automated program working a large order as a steady stream of small market orders ("clips"), for minutes to hours. On a chart
 * it is a CVD line that runs straight; here it is told by its clips, after Argus_Bot's execution-program detector (Binance spot, 2026-07).
 *
 * Every market order from `minClipUsd` goes into a logarithmic size bucket, and a bucket with its two neighbours makes a size family (the
 * clip size is found, never set). Each minute, over the ten minutes up to its end, a family is a candidate when it jointly has
 *  - enough clips and dollars a minute on its side (`minRate`, `minUsdPerMin`), most of its clips on that side (`minDirection`),
 *  - a cadence: the gaps between the seconds holding its clips have one most common length, at most `maxGap` seconds, that takes at least
 *    `minGapShare` of them, and its last clip at most `maxStaleS` before the minute's end,
 *  - for the exact kind, sizes within `maxSpread` of their median (a fixed clip: Argus's rule). The wide kind (buckets 50 % apart, so a
 *    family spans about 3.4 times in size; no size test; more clips a minute) finds programs that draw each clip's size at random, as the
 *    ETH spot buyer of 2026-10-10 did ($1-6K about once a second), which no fixed-size test sees. Narrower wide families split such a range
 *    between minutes and lose its cadence (25 %: its gap share hovered at 46-59 %, a candidate in a third of its minutes).
 * A family that is a candidate for `sustain` minutes is an episode: the first of those minutes is its onset, the last its alert; up to
 * `pendingSlack` missed minutes in a row on the way do not start it over (Argus allowed none, and missed an ETH spot seller of 6 ETH
 * clips that paused two minutes between runs of 14 and 13, 2026-10-07 15:41-16:09). It goes on while a family of its side overlapping its
 * sizes stays a candidate with `keepDirection` of its clips on that side, and ends after `inactivity` minutes without one. The same side
 * and clip again within `suppressMin` is a repeat: kept, not announced.
 *
 * The clips are the market orders rebuilt from fills (orders.ts): a child order that took two price levels is one clip, where Binance's
 * aggregate trades split it. Each second keeps at most `perSecond` orders a side, the largest. A minute is judged on the exchange's times
 * once `step` is given a clock `GRACE_MS` past its end; an order arriving later still counts in the windows after it. Measured on Binance
 * 2026-10-06..10 (docs/slicers-2026-10-10.md). What this says is what traded: a program can be half of a hedge (a BTC spot seller and a
 * perpetual buyer ran $4.14K clips in the same seconds on 2026-10-10), and nothing here knows who or why.
