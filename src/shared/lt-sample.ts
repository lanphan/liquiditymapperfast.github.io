/**
 * The Liquidity Tracker as the recorder keeps it: every venue's book, at every sample, measured from that venue's own best bid and best
 * ask (as Bookmap measures one instrument), for each half-life the pane offers. Venues do not trade at one price (USDT spot sits several bp
 * above the perpetuals, USD spot below them), so a level is near the touch when it is near its own venue's touch; measured from one price
 * shared by every venue, the weights followed the venues' premiums instead of the liquidity (measured 2026-10-11: 6.7 points of imbalance
 * apart at a 10 bp half-life, the other side in a quarter of the minutes).
 *
 * It is taken from each sample's book, before the minute is averaged: a minute's average book is smeared by the price moving inside it,
 * and its best bid is the highest of the minute, which put a moving minute's bids 13 % short (6 points of imbalance). Kept as means over
 * the samples of a minute, each venue apart; windows of minutes average them by their samples, and venues add up.
